Specimens of the genus were discovered in Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument in 2006 and 2007. It had an estimated length of 4.5 m (15 ft) and weight of 1.2 t (1.3 short tons).

It had a triangular beak with a pointed tip, a blade-like nasal horn, and two horns that pointed up and to the sides, then downwards.
